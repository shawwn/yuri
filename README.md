I'm not sure where to post this. It's a bit crazy, but it seems to be true.

If you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRj0lymMMGs) and pause at 6:45, you can see an eel eating him.

I don't think anyone else is aware of this. The official explanation is that he dove to the bottom for fun and then died. But it's pretty clear his buoyancy compensator failed, and then he had the misfortune of pissing off an eel.

(He was probably dead either way due to the fact that the air becomes poisonous at that depth unless specially pressurized. But, if he was in fact eaten by an eel, it seems unfair that no one knows about it.)

Try it. To see this, you must do a few things:

1. Turn down the lights. This is important, because the human visual system processes images differently depending on the ambient lighting of your area.

2. Turn up your screen brightness. The video is inherently dark, so it's difficult to see.

3. Make the video full screen.

4. Watch the video starting from around 6 minutes in. When it gets to 6:45, stare at the upper left corner of the screen. 

Here's a link to the exact timestamp that you can clearly see an eel come into the frame and start eating him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRj0lymMMGs#t=6m43s

Most people I show this to don't seem to see anything at all. There are a few points to support this being true:

- You can see debris floating around that Yuri clearly could not have generated. For example, pieces of plastic from his diving equipment. You can also see shreds of his suit floating around.

- Near the end of the video, there seems to be blood on the lens of the camera. The blood creeps up the middle of the frame, independent of the water around it. I think the blood is *inside* the camera, on the lens, which is why it doesn't get washed away.

- When Yuri hits the bottom, he immediately uses his depth sensor to figure out which direction he should walk in order to get back to the surface. Deeper = wrong direction. This implies he was of clear mind and that he didn't dive down there intentionally.
